### 50 Days Summer Challenge

#### Overview
This repository contains code for organizing and managing a 50-day summer challenge focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) topics alongside web development tasks. The main purpose is to provide a structured learning path for individuals looking to enhance their skills in these areas over the summer.

#### Code Description
The provided Python script utilizes the Pandas library to create and manipulate data related to the DSA topics and web development tasks for each day of the challenge. The data includes the date, the DSA topic or subtopic/task for the day, and the corresponding development task.

#### Instructions
1. **Installation**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, install the Pandas and Openpyxl library if not already installed (`pip install openpyxl`) (`pip install pandas`).

```
pip install pandas openpyxl
```


2. **Usage**:
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.
   - Execute the `main.py` script.
   - The script will generate a corrected DataFrame and save it to an Excel file named `dsa_and_development_schedule_corrected.xlsx` in the repository directory.
   - Review the Excel file to view the structured schedule for the 50-day challenge.

#### Schedule Structure
The schedule is structured with a focus on alternating days between DSA topics and web development tasks. Each day is designated with a specific DSA topic or subtopic/task, followed by a corresponding web development task. This alternating pattern aims to provide a balanced learning experience.
